# Simple whois Script

1. Fill `domain.txt` with one URL per line
2. `$ ./whois.sh`

This is a simple bash script that runs the command `whois` for each url in a
file. You will need the command `whois installed`.

You can use your favorite package manager to install the command.

## Example

`sudo pacman -S whois`
